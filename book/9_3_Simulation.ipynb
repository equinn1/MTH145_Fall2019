    "### Simulation ###\n",
    "Simulation is the process of using a computer to mimic a physical experiment. In this class, those experiments will almost invariably involve chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen how to simulate the results of tosses of a coin. The steps in that simulation were examples of the steps that will constitute every simulation we do in this course. In this section we will set out those steps and follow them in examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: What to Simulate ###\n",
    "Specify the quantity you want to simulate. For example, you might decide that you want to simulate the outcomes of tosses of a coin. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Simulating One Value ###\n",
    "Figure out how to simulate *one* value of the quantity you specified in Step 1. In our example, you have to figure out how to simulate the outcome of *one* toss of a coin. If your quantity is more complicated, you might need several lines of code to come up with one simulated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Number of Repetitions ###\n",
    "Decide how many times you want to simulate the quantity. You will have to repeat Step 2 that many times. In one of our earlier examples we had decided to simulate the outcomes of 1000 tosses of a coin, and so we needed 1000 repetitions of generating the outcome of a single toss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Coding the Simulation ###\n",
    "Put it all together in code.\n",
    "- Create an empty array in which to collect all the simulated values. We will call this the collection array.\n",
    "- Create a \"repetitions sequence,\" that is, a sequence whose length is the number of repetitions you specified in Step 3. For `n` repetitions we will almost always use the sequence `np.arange(n)`.\n",
    "- Create a `for` loop. For each element of the repetitions sequence:\n",
    "    - Simulate *one* value based on the code you developed in Step 2.\n",
    "    - Augment the collection array with this simulated value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "That's it! Once you have carried out the steps above, your simulation is done. The collection array contains all the simulated values. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you can use the collection array as you would any other array. You can visualize the distribution of the simulated values, count how many simulated values fall into a particular category, and so on."
