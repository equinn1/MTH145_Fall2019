Instead, you should use it only once, at the very end, after you've finalized your classifier, when you want an unbiased estimate of its accuracy."

There are several different procedures for doing that.  Brittany focused on fine needle aspiration (FNA), because it is less invasive than the alternatives.  The doctor gets a sample of the mass, puts it under a microscope, takes a picture, and a trained lab tech analyzes the picture to determine whether it is cancer or not.  We get a picture like one of the following:\n",

The idea is that we'll ask the lab tech to analyze the image and compute various attributes: things like the typical size of a cell, how much variation there is among the cell sizes, and so on.  Then, we'll try to use this information to predict (classify) whether the sample is malignant or not.  We have a training set of past samples from women where the correct diagnosis is known, and we'll hope that our machine learning algorithm can use those to learn how to predict the diagnosis for future samples.\n",

One key innovation is that she incorporated a confidence score into her results: her algorithm had a way to determine when it was not able to make a confident prediction, and for those patients, it didn't even try to predict their diagnosis.  Her algorithm was 99% accurate on the patients where it made a prediction -- so that extension seemed to help quite a bit."
