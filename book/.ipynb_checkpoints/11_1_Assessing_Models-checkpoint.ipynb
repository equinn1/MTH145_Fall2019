    "### U.S. Supreme Court, 1965: Swain vs. Alabama ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1960's, in Talladega County in Alabama, a black man called Robert Swain was convicted of raping a white woman and was sentenced to death. He appealed his sentence, citing among other factors the all-white jury. At the time, only men aged 21 or older were allowed to serve on juries in Talladega County. In the county, 26% of the eligible jurors were black, but there were only 8 black men among the 100 selected for the jury panel in Swain's trial. No black man was selected for the trial jury.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1965, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Swain's appeal. In its ruling, the Court wrote \"... the overall percentage disparity has been small and reflects no studied attempt to include or exclude a specified number of Negroes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Jury panels are supposed to be selected at random from the eligible population. Because 26% of the eligible population was black, 8 black men on a panel of 100 might seem low.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Model ###\n",
    "But one view of the data – a model, in other words – is that the panel was selected at random and ended up with a small number of black men just due to chance. This model is consistent with what the Supreme Court wrote in its ruling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model specifies the details of a chance process. It says the data are like a random sample from a population in which 26% of the people are black. We are in a good position to assess this model, because:\n",
    "- We can simulate data based on the model. That is, we can simulate drawing at random from a population of whom 26% are black. \n",
    "- Our simulation will show what a panel *would* look like *if* it were selected at random.\n",
    "- We can then compare the results of the simulation with the composition of Robert Swain's panel. \n",
    "- If the results of our simulation are not consistent with the composition of Swain's panel, that will be evidence against the model of random selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through the process in detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Statistic ###\n",
    "First, we have to choose a statistic to simulate. The statistic has to be able to help us decide between the model and alternative views about the data. The model says the panel was drawn at random. The alternative viewpoint, suggested by Robert Swain's appeal, is that the panel was not drawn at random because it contained too few black men. A natural statistic, then, is the number of black men in our simulated sample of 100 men representing the panel. Small values of the statistic will favor the alternative viewpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicting the Statistic Under the Model ###\n",
    "If the model were true, how big would the statistic typically be? To answer that, we have to start by working out the details of the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating One Value of the Statistic ####\n",
    "First let's figure out how to simulate one value of the statistic. For this, we have to sample 100 times at random from the population of eligible jurors and count the number of black men we get.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to set up a table representing the eligible population and use `sample` as we did in the previous chapter. But there is also a quicker way, using a `datascience` function tailored for sampling at random from categorical distributions. We will use it several times in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sample_proportions` function in the `datascience` library takes two arguments:\n",
    "- the sample size\n",
    "- the distribution of the categories in the population, as a list or array of proportions that add up to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns an array containing the distribution of the categories in a random sample of the given size taken from the population. That's an array consisting of the sample proportions in all the different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how to use this, remember that according to our model, the panel is selected at random from a population of men among whom 26% were black and 74% were not. Thus the distribution of the two categories can be represented as the list `[0.26, 0.74]`, which we have assigned to the name `eligible_population`. Now let's sample at random 100 times from this distribution, and see what proportions of the two categories we get in our sample."
