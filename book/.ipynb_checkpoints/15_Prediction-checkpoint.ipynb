    "The foundations of the method were laid by [Sir Francis Galton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton). As we saw in Section 7.1, Galton studied how physical characteristics are passed down from one generation to the next. Among his best known work is the prediction of the heights of adults based on the heights of their parents. We have studied the dataset that Galton collected for this. The table `heights` contains his data on the midparent height and child's height (all in inches) for a population of 934 adult \"children\"."
