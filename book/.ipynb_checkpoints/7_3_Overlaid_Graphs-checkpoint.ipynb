For `scatter` and `plot`, one column must serve as the common horizontal axis for all the overlaid graphs. For `barh`, one column must serve as the common axis which is the set of categories.

Indeed, you will notice that the entire gold graph (2014) looks like the blue graph (2010) slid over to the right by 4 years. The slide is accompanied by a slight rise due to the net effect of children who entered the country between 2010 and 2014 outnumbering those who left. Fortunately at these ages there is not much loss of life."
